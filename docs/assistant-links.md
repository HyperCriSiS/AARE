# Car links

Assistant apps such as Claude or ChatGPT can't call AARE's car tools: they only write text, and
they have no tool to open a link on the phone. Car links close that gap without a touch from the
driver:

1. The assistant answers as usual and puts a car link behind a single emoji.
2. The voice reading the reply aloud skips the emoji and the address behind it.
3. A MacroDroid macro sees the emoji on the screen and taps it.
4. Android hands the link to AARE instead of the browser, and AARE runs the car tool.

## Links

`https://aare.internal/go/<tool>?<arguments>`, for every car tool (see the README). `.internal`
is reserved for private networks and never resolves on the internet: there is no website behind
these links, so a link AARE doesn't take goes nowhere, and no destination leaks to a server.
AARE claims the address for itself through Shizuku or root when the car screen starts. Chat apps
make only `http` and `https` addresses tappable, which is why it is not an `aare://` link.

| Link | Does |
|---|---|
| `…/go/car_navigate?destination=Berlin` | navigates to the place in the car's navigation app |
| `…/go/car_media?action=next` | `play`, `pause`, `next` or `previous` |
| `…/go/car_display?mode=dark` | `dark`, `light` or `auto` (the car's day/night setting) |
| `…/go/car_open?what=Spotify` | shows an app, `home` or `apps`; never the phone screen mirror |
| `…/go/car_status` | AARE says what's playing, the next turn and the phone's battery |
| `…/go/car_messages` | AARE reads the latest messages aloud (`app=WhatsApp` for one app only) |
| `…/go/car_reply?conversation=Max&message=…` | sends the reply (`app=` when several conversations have that name) |
| `…/go/car_mark_read?conversation=Max` | marks the conversation as read |

The assistant never sees what a link did, so AARE speaks for it: the messages, the status, or
"That didn't work." when a tool fails. Everything else is silent; the assistant has already said it.

AARE runs a link only when the car (or the car screen preview) is connected and the app that
opened it is the voice assistant chosen in AARE (*Voice assistant* page).

> [!WARNING]
> Android takes the app that opened a link from what that app says about itself, and any app can
> claim to be the assistant. While the car is connected, an app on the phone could therefore send
> `car_reply` links and reply to your conversations in your name. Only install apps you trust.

The links need no setting in Android: when AARE starts a hosted app through Shizuku or root, it
approves its own link domain, so Android opens them in AARE without asking.

## Assistant instructions

Put this into the assistant's instructions, for example a Claude project used in the car or
ChatGPT's custom instructions:

```
You are my assistant in the car. Answer in one or two short sentences.
When I want something done in the car, answer briefly and add a last line with only an
emoji that links to the car action. Only one such line per answer. Arguments are URL-encoded.

- Navigate:      [🧭](https://aare.internal/go/car_navigate?destination=<place>)
- Play:          [▶️](https://aare.internal/go/car_media?action=play)
- Pause:         [⏸️](https://aare.internal/go/car_media?action=pause)
- Next:          [⏭️](https://aare.internal/go/car_media?action=next)
- Previous:      [⏮️](https://aare.internal/go/car_media?action=previous)
- Dark/light:    [🌙](https://aare.internal/go/car_display?mode=dark) or
                 [☀️](https://aare.internal/go/car_display?mode=light)
- Show an app:   [📱](https://aare.internal/go/car_open?what=<app, home or apps>)
- Car status:    [ℹ️](https://aare.internal/go/car_status)
- Read messages: [📨](https://aare.internal/go/car_messages)
- Reply:         [✉️](https://aare.internal/go/car_reply?conversation=<name>&message=<text>)
- Mark as read:  [✅](https://aare.internal/go/car_mark_read?conversation=<name>)

The car reads status and messages aloud itself; you don't see them, so don't make them up.
Before a reply, read it back and wait for my yes; only then add the link.
If a place, app or name is unclear, ask first and add no link.

Example: "Take me to Berlin main station" →
Alright, have a good trip!
[🧭](https://aare.internal/go/car_navigate?destination=Berlin%20Hauptbahnhof)
```

## MacroDroid macro

- **Trigger:** *Screen Content*, only in the assistant app (for example Claude), text contains
  any of the emojis above (one trigger per emoji, or a regular expression).
- **Action:** *UI Interaction → Click* on the same text (the emoji).
- **Constraint (optional):** only while the phone is connected to the car.

MacroDroid needs its accessibility service for both. The tap comes from inside the assistant app,
so Android reports the assistant as the link's sender, which AARE requires.

## Not tested yet

- A tap on a link in the Claude app's voice mode in the car, and whether it stops voice mode.
- Whether Android reports the assistant as the sender for every assistant app.
- Whether MacroDroid sees the assistant when AARE shows it on the car screen's virtual display.
- Whether AARE's speech and the assistant's voice mode get in each other's way.
- Music search and phone calls have no car link; they still need the phone's own apps.
